# Algorithms and Data Structures in C

A collection of algorithms and data structures I've learned, implemented in the C language.

**Remeber**: compile with `gcc -fsanitize=address -g -Wall -o <output_name> <script_name.c>` 

## Next Steps
- [X] Document code and Readme in English
- [X] Develop data structures:
  - [X] Single Linked List
  - [X] Double Linked List
  - [X] Stack
  - [X] Queue
  - [X] Tree
  - [X] Binary Tree
  - [X] Binary Search Tree
  - [ ] Binary Search Tree AVL
